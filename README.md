This repository contains the work developed for my Master's Thesis (TFM), submitted to the Universidad de Granada. The TFM focuses on the analysis of financial time series using ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) and GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models, specifically applied to the returns of Corporaci√≥n Favorita in Ecuador. The main goal is to explore and apply these models to model volatility in financial data, evaluating their performance and utility in time series forecasting.
